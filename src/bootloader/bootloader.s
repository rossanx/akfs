 * THANKS TO GRUB, OSDEV, AND BROWN (INTERRUPT LIST) FOR THE VALUABLE
 * INFORMATION ON DETECTING MEMORY WITH 0xE820 !!!
 *
 * BROWN LIST ENTRY FOR 0XE820 -> http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-1741.htm:
    "AX = E820h
     EAX = 0000E820h
     EDX = 534D4150h ('SMAP')
     EBX = continuation value or 00000000h to start at beginning of map
     ECX = size of buffer for result, in bytes (should be >= 20 bytes)
     ES:DI -> buffer for result (see #00581)

     Return:
     CF clear if successful
     EAX = 534D4150h ('SMAP')
     ES:DI buffer filled
     EBX = next offset from which to copy or 00000000h if all done
     ECX = actual length returned in bytes
     CF set on error
     AH = error code (86h) (see #00496 at INT 15/AH=80h)
	
   Notes: ... A maximum of 20 bytes will be transferred at one time,
	even if ECX is higher; some BIOSes ... ignore the value of ECX
	on entry, and always copy 20 bytes. Some BIOSes expect the
	high word of EAX to be clear on entry, i.e. EAX=0000E820h...
	The BIOS is permitted to return a nonzero continuation value
	in EBX and indicate that the end of the list has already been
	reached by returning with CF set on the next iteration. This
	function will return base memory and ISA/PCI memory contiguous
	with base memory as normal memory ranges; it will indicate
	chipset-defined address holes which are not in use and
	motherboard memory-mapped devices, and all occurrences of the
	system BIOS as reserved; standard PC address ranges will not
	be reported "
